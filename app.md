The application will consist of:

1. A backend to provide the following functions: 

   a. Resolve an address into a Lat/Lon using the Google Places API
   
   b. Find drop-off locations within range of a Lat/Lon
   
   c. Register a user (minimal information required - just a phone number, really)
   
   d. Assign points to a user during drop-off
   
   e. Return a user's current points
   
2. USSD interface to the backend:
   
   a. Present a prompt like "Enter your location to find drop-off centres near you"
   
   b. Respond to the user's query with a list of centres from the backend
   
   c. Register the number of bottles and bags collected by a user, at a drop-off point
   
3. A Progressive Web App (PWA) to be used by collectors, as well as users
